Weather Data Visualizer
Data Analysis & Visualization Project

This project focuses on working with real-world weather datasets using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
You will clean data, compute statistics, visualize trends, and generate meaningful insights.

📘 Project Overview

The goals of this project are to:

Load and inspect real weather datasets

Clean missing or inconsistent data

Process date/time columns

Compute statistical summaries using NumPy

Create multiple weather-related visualizations

Group and aggregate data for deeper insights

Export results and tell a data-driven story

This project demonstrates practical skills useful in data analysis, data science, and Python visualization.

🗂️ Assignment Tasks
Task 1: Data Acquisition and Loading

Download a real CSV file of local or open-source weather data
Examples: Kaggle datasets, IMD, NOAA, WeatherAPI logs.

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame

Inspect its structure using:

df.head()

df.info()

df.describe()

Deliverable:
✔ Loaded DataFrame + inspection results

Task 2: Data Cleaning and Processing

Handle missing values (drop or fill with mean/median/forward-fill)

Convert date columns to proper datetime format

Filter relevant columns (e.g., temperature, rainfall, humidity)

Remove duplicates if any

Deliverable:
✔ Cleaned DataFrame ready for analysis

Task 3: Statistical Analysis with NumPy

Compute statistics:

Daily, monthly, yearly analysis

Mean, min, max, standard deviation

Use NumPy functions like:

np.mean()

np.std()

np.min()

np.max()

Deliverable:
✔ Summary of computed statistics

Task 4: Visualization with Matplotlib

Create the following plots:

📈 1. Line Chart

Daily temperature trends

📊 2. Bar Chart

Monthly rainfall totals

🔵 3. Scatter Plot

Humidity vs. temperature

➕ 4. Combined Figure

At least two plots in one figure

Deliverable:
✔ 4 visualizations using Matplotlib
✔ Clear titles, labels, grids, legends

Task 5: Grouping and Aggregation

Use Pandas .groupby() to:

Group data by month, season, or year

Calculate aggregated statistics:

Avg temperature per month

Total rainfall per season

Avg humidity per year

Also use .resample() for time-series aggregation (optional)

Deliverable:
✔ Grouped results + aggregated tables

Task 6: Export and Storytelling

Export cleaned dataset to a new CSV

Save all plots as PNG files

Write a Markdown or text report summarizing:

Insights

Observed trends

Seasonal behavior

Comparisons

Deliverables:
