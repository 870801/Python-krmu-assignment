Campus Energy-Use Dashboard
Capstone Project – Programming for Problem Solving using Python
📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing campus electricity consumption using Python. You will build an end-to-end pipeline—from reading raw meter data to generating insights and visual dashboards that help the facilities team make better decisions about energy usage.
🎯 Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn to:


Read, validate, and combine multiple datasets using Pandas


Implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to model real-world entities


Perform time-series and categorical aggregations


Create multi-chart visualizations using Matplotlib


Export processed datasets and generate an executive summary report

✔️ Task Breakdown
🧩 Task 1 – Data Ingestion & Validation


Read multiple .csv files from /data/


Merge into one DataFrame


Add building metadata if missing


Handle:


Missing files


Corrupt rows




Output: df_combined



📈 Task 2 – Core Aggregation Logic
Functions to implement:
calculate_daily_totals(df)
calculate_weekly_aggregates(df)
building_wise_summary(df)

You will compute:


Daily totals


Weekly totals


Per-building mean, min, max, total consumption



🏛️ Task 3 – Object-Oriented Modeling
Create:
class Building


name


list of meter readings


methods: add_reading(), calculate_total_consumption(), generate_report()


class MeterReading


timestamp


kWh value


class BuildingManager


manages all buildings


produces combined reports



📊 Task 4 – Visualization (Matplotlib Dashboard)
Create a single PNG (dashboard.png) containing:


Line chart – daily consumption (all buildings)


Bar chart – weekly averages per building


Scatter plot – peak-hour usage


Use:
plt.subplots()

Include titles, legends, axes labels.

📁 Task 5 – Data Export & Summary
Export:


cleaned_energy_data.csv


building_summary.csv


Generate a summary.txt containing:


Total campus electricity usage


Highest-consuming building


Peak load time


Daily/weekly patterns



📝 Deliverables Checklist
