Daily Calorie Tracker (Python CLI Tool)
A simple Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) project that helps users log their meals, track calorie intake, compare it with a daily limit, and generate a summary report. This tool is perfect for beginners learning Python basics like input handling, lists, loops, arithmetic operations, and string formatting.

📘 Project Overview
The Daily Calorie Tracker allows users to:


Enter meal names and corresponding calorie counts


Calculate total and average calorie intake


Compare the total calories with the user’s personal daily limit


Display a formatted summary table


Strengthen logical thinking while practicing real-world Python CLI development



🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this mini-project, learners will be able to:


Use input(), type conversion, and basic I/O operations in Python


Store and manage input using lists


Apply arithmetic and comparison operators


Use f-strings for clean and readable output formatting


Implement if-else logic for decision-making


Practice basic file structure and scripting



🛠️ Assignment Tasks
Task 1: Setup & Introduction


Create a project folder: daily_calorie_tracker/


Inside the folder, create tracker.py


Add a header comment with your name, date, and project title


Print a welcome message describing the purpose of the tool


📌 Deliverable: tracker.py with welcome message and program intro.

Task 2: Input & Data Collection


Use input() to accept:


Meal name (e.g., "Breakfast")


Calorie amount (converted to int or float)




Store meal names in one list and calorie amounts in another


Ask user how many meals they want to enter (use a loop)


📌 Deliverable: Working input logic with list storage.

Task 3: Calorie Calculations


Use sum() to calculate total calorie intake


Compute average calories per meal


Ask user for their daily calorie limit, then compare with total


📌 Deliverable: Correct total & average calorie calculation and comparison.

Task 4: Exceed Limit Warning System
Use if...else or elif to:


Show warning if total > limit


Otherwise show success/within-limit message


📌 Deliverable: A working warning system using comparison operators.

Task 5: Neatly Formatted Output
Print a summary table using f-strings:
Meal Name      Calories
-------------------------
Breakfast      350
Lunch          600
Snack          150
Total:         1100

📌 Deliverable: Clean and well-formatted summary output.
